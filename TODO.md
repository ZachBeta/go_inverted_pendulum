# done
* basic parts in place

# now
* [ ] fetch and summarize double pendulum video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gQQAO4I1Ck
* [ ] try to gain more insights into the training process and the neural networks
I want better insights into how the neural network is training, 

# next
* video summaries need cleanup especially if they're helping to feed context and determine features and implementation details
    * rerun all video summaries from subtitles, maybe add a processing layer of converting the srt to plain text, then summarize
    * can we discern anything from the video?
    * skim all markdown for anything valuable, trash them, and create new ones
        * even if there is anything useful in there, it's surrounded by so much noise, we should probably keep it tighter, more readable, more understandable, less technical jargon, more clear behavior 
        * this includes README.md, RULES, ARCHITECTURE.md, PROGRESS.MD, TRAINING.MD
