# Screenshot Analysis and Implementation Insights

## Network Architecture
### Node Processing
- Nodes are processed in topological order
- Each node:
  1. Adds bias value
  2. Applies activation function
  3. Multiplies by connection weight
  4. Adds result to destination neuron's sum

### Network Structure
- Based on directed acyclic graphs (DAG)
- Uses NEAT-inspired evolutionary approach
- Supports dynamic network growth through mutation

## Training Process
### Stages
1. **Evaluation**
   - Network processes inputs
   - Performance scored based on success criteria
   - Scores used for selection

2. **Selection**
   - Top 30% performers automatically selected
   - Additional random selection proportional to score
   - Creates pool for evolution

3. **Mutation**
   - New connection creation
   - Connection splitting
   - Weight modification
   - Maintains network validity through DAG constraints

## Performance Optimization
### Matrix Operations
- Future enhancement: Convert to layered networks
- Enables matrix multiplication optimization
- Potential for massive parallelization using goroutines
