# INTRODUCTION

[00:00:00]
Machine learning is a hot topic and for good reason. It has unlocked the ability 
for our computers to perform a whole host of tasks that we simply didn't know 
how to program manually. This fascinating discipline is also a lot of fun to try 
out on your own but can be quite daunting due to its many mathematical and 
programming prerequisites, especially if you want to write everything from 
scratch yourself.

A branch of machine learning called reinforcement learning is particularly 
appealing. It promises to teach a program to perform complex tasks by letting it 
carry out its own experiments in a given environment. However, this set of 
techniques requires an excellent understanding of the machine learning 
principles on which it is based.

In this video, I'm going to show you how to create a very simple AI capable of 
learning to perform a basic task. This approach does at least allow you to build 
up an intuition about the fundamental concepts.

# NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE

[00:01:01]
We'll be using a specific type of neural networks called DAGs - Directed Acyclic 
Graphs. These are a kind of graphs in which there are no cycles. Networks are 
made up of nodes, and each node can receive input from other nodes.

The network we'll build has three types of nodes:
1. Input nodes - receiving information from the environment
2. Hidden nodes - processing the information
3. Output nodes - determining the action to take

# TRAINING PROCESS

[00:03:22]
The network processes information through these nodes. At the end of this 
process, we get an output that determines what action to take. The training is 
carried out in iterations, with each iteration evaluating how well the network 
performs the task.

We score the final performance, and the final step is to evolve the networks so 
that they produce slightly better results in the next generation.

# SUCCESS CRITERIA

[00:07:03]
Success is measured by whether the network manages to keep the end of the 
pendulum above a threshold. This threshold is gradually increased as training 
progresses.

[00:08:30]
The initial results aren't too bad, but there's a strong oscillation in the 
movement. Let's adapt the fitness function again to push the solutions towards 
the desired behavior.

# OPTIMIZATION AND RESULTS

[00:11:13]
Through progressive optimization of both the network architecture and the 
fitness function, we eventually achieve a solution that can successfully balance 
the pendulum with minimal oscillation.

The final network is surprisingly simple, demonstrating that even basic neural 
networks can learn to perform complex control tasks when trained with the right 
approach.

# CONCLUSION

This simple example demonstrates the core principles of reinforcement learning:
1. Creating a neural network architecture
2. Defining a clear success metric
3. Implementing a training process
4. Progressively increasing difficulty
5. Optimizing the solution through generations

While this is a simplified approach, it provides insight into how more complex 
reinforcement learning systems operate and can serve as a foundation for 
exploring more advanced techniques.
