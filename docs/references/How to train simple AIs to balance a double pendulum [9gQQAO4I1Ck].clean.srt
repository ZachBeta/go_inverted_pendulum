# INTRODUCTION

[00:00:00]
In my previous video we saw how a simple Evolution algorithm could be used to 
solve simple tasks such as balancing a simple pendulum. It's best to watch it 
first if you want to know the details of the algorithm used to perform the 
training.

However, this specific task was very simple requiring only a few seconds for the 
algorithm or even a human to find a solution. The various solutions found, while 
very effective in solving the problem, were also very simple with neural 
networks of just a few nodes.

In this second part, we'll see if a basic algorithm such as the one described in 
the first video can succeed in finding a solution for a far more complex and 
precise exercise: balancing a double pendulum.

# COMPARING SINGLE VS DOUBLE PENDULUM COMPLEXITY

First of all, is it really that much more complicated to have a double pendulum? 
Let's compare the two systems.

The simple pendulum as we can see is pretty easy to get the hang of it and only 
requires a few attempts to be able to balance it. The double pendulum, on the 
other hand, is much more difficult to control manually. The second pendulum adds 
a lot of complexity to the system, making it much more difficult to predict and 
control.

This property makes the control window much thinner than in the case of the 
simple pendulum. Double pendulums are quite hypnotic to watch.

# TRAINING SETUP AND METHODOLOGY

Let's see if our algorithm can find a solution to balance this system. For the 
training, I'll set the length of the pendulum equal to the length of the 
pendulum minus 5%.

Let's start the training using 1,000 neural networks. I've tried lots of 
different configurations and score functions to find an effective approach.

# TRAINING PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES

[00:10:53]
I'll set a threshold that I can easily link to the success criteria. There's now 
the beginnings of a strategy forming. This kind of strategy is to control the 
oscillations.

Let's start from scratch with this new function and see if it produces better 
results. I'm going to fast forward to the interesting parts of the training.

# RESULTS AND SOLUTION

Let's examine the solution from this latest experiment. This appears to be the 
best solution found for the time being.

# CONCLUSION

Despite the complexity of the double pendulum system, we've managed to find a 
working solution using our rudimentary algorithm. However, there are quite a few 
improvements that could be made to the approach.

The neural network has learned to apply the right amount of force at the right 
time to keep the double pendulum balanced, which is quite impressive given the 
chaotic nature of the system.
