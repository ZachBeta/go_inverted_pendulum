* reinforcement learning
* https://github.com/johnBuffer/Pendulum-NEAT
* find neat paper
* evolutionary algorithms
* directed acyclic graphs
* topological sorting of nodes - there's a wikipedia page
* step by step of node process in SRT
* add bias, activation function, multiply this by connection weight and add to sum in destination neuron
* soon: layered networks - matrix multiplications that are massively paralellizable - we can use go routines for this
* stages - evaluation, selection, mutation
* sort selct, top 30%, randomly select proportional to score, evolve network to slightly different result - mutation - new connection, split a connection, modify a weight
