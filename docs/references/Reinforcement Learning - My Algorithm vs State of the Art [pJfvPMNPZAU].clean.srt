# INTRODUCTION

[00:00:00]
In my last two videos on AI training I presented a rudimentary but highly 
effective technique for solving simple tasks, in this case balancing a single 
and then a double pendulum. In the first very simple case, a robust solution was 
found in less than a minute. The resulting neural network was also very compact, 
comprising no more than three hidden neurons.

In the second case it was more difficult, with training lasting between 2 and 8 
hours, and only succeeding in finding a solution one time out of four on 
average. The training required a slightly different strategy as the algorithm 
was initially unable to find a solution. It was therefore necessary to gradually 
increase the difficulty of the task via gravity and air friction to achieve a 
successful balance.

But in the event of loss of equilibrium, none of the solutions could recover 
balance effectively.

# COMPARISON WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART

[00:02:21]
Today, I want to compare my rudimentary approach with state-of-the-art tools 
that exploit the capabilities of these reinforcement learning frameworks.

NVIDIA provides a framework called Isaac Sim that implements its own version of 
the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm, which is considered one of the 
most effective reinforcement learning approaches.

# ISAAC SIM SETUP

[00:04:50]
Let's familiarize ourselves with Isaac Sim and set up our experiment. We'll 
place the cart in the middle of the rail and set up the environment parameters 
to match our previous experiments.

# TRAINING RESULTS COMPARISON

[00:07:40]
The results are quite satisfactory, especially after only 2 minutes of training. 
No matter what force is applied, the system quickly recovers and maintains 
balance.

[00:09:51]
NVIDIA's framework has been open-source since then. Its use within the 
reinforcement learning community has grown significantly due to its 
effectiveness and ease of use.

# IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

[00:11:02]
Once in Isaac Sim, a simple drag and drop interface allows us to set up the 
environment. For the double pendulum case, we must now take the second pendulum 
into account in our training process.

# PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

[00:14:09]
I didn't expect such efficiency, especially as I was using a relatively simple 
configuration. No matter what happens to the pendulum, the system always returns 
to a balanced state.

[00:17:21]
This demonstrates the power of gradient descent. The two algorithms simply are 
not in the same league. Modern reinforcement learning approaches have 
significantly advanced the field of artificial intelligence in recent times.

# CONCLUSION

The comparison between my simple evolutionary approach and state-of-the-art 
reinforcement learning algorithms shows the tremendous progress in the field. 
While my approach was effective for simple tasks, modern algorithms like PPO 
implemented in frameworks such as Isaac Sim can solve complex control problems 
much more efficiently and robustly.

This doesn't diminish the value of understanding simpler approaches, as they 
provide important insights into the fundamental principles of reinforcement 
learning. However, for practical applications, leveraging state-of-the-art tools 
can provide significantly better results with less development effort.
