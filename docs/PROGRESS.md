## Reference Implementation Details

Our implementation is based on Pezzza's original work but focuses on classical control methods rather than neural networks. Key differences include:
- Deterministic control vs learned behaviors
- Immutable state management
- Real-time performance focus
- Comprehensive testing framework

For the original implementation details, see [references/README.md](references/README.md).
