## Architecture Decisions

### Current ADRs
1. **State Management**
   - Immutable patterns for thread safety
   - DAG-based system representation
   - Performance impact documented

2. **Control Strategy**
   - Classical control vs RL approach
   - Deterministic actions
   - Progressive complexity implementation

3. **Performance Focus**
   - Real-time optimization priority
   - Minimal initial parameters
   - Stage separation for validation

## Reference Implementation

Our implementation builds on Pezzza's original work while focusing on classical control methods. Key differences include:
- Deterministic control vs learned behaviors
- Immutable state management
- Real-time performance focus
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Progressive complexity approach
