# Neural Network Implementation Action Plan

## Phase 1: Core Architecture
1. **DAG-Based Network Structure**
   - Implement directed acyclic graph representation
   - Add topological sorting for node processing
   - Set up basic node structure with bias and activation functions
   - Implement weight connections between nodes

2. **Three-Node Architecture**
   - Input layer implementation
   - Hidden layer with configurable size
   - Output layer with action space mapping
   - Connection weight management

## Phase 2: Training Pipeline
1. **Progressive Learning Implementation**
   - Evaluation stage
   - Selection mechanism (top 30% performers)
   - Score-based random selection
   - Mutation strategies:
     - New connection creation
     - Connection splitting
     - Weight modification

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Matrix multiplication implementation
   - Goroutine parallelization for layered networks

   - Add network complexity progression
   - Implement fitness scoring

2. **Training Process**
   - State value prediction
   - Momentum-based backpropagation
   - Progressive learning with reward prioritization
   - Adaptive learning rate implementation

## Phase 4: Persistence and Visualization
1. **Network State Management**
   - Checkpoint system implementation
   - Network state serialization
   - Save/load functionality
   - Training progress persistence
