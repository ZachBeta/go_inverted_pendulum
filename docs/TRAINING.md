# Training Progress Verification

## Overview
The training system uses a combination of real-time metrics, logging, and checkpoints to verify learning progress.

## Key Metrics
1. **Episode Success Rate**
   - Time pendulum stays upright (in seconds)
   - Maximum angle deviation from vertical
   - Number of successful recoveries

2. **Learning Progress**
   - Average reward per batch
   - Weight changes over time
   - Learning rate adaptation

3. **Performance Indicators**
   - Training speed (episodes/second)
   - Memory usage
   - Checkpoint sizes

## Verification Methods

### 1. Real-time Console Output
Training progress is displayed in real-time with structured logging:
```
[Training] Episode 100 Summary
├── Duration: 10.5s
├── Max Angle: 15.2°
├── Avg Reward: 0.85
└── Weights
    ├── Angle: 2.15
    ├── Angular Velocity: 1.08
    └── Bias: 0.12
```

### 2. Automated Tests
Unit tests verify core training functionality:
- Batch processing
- Weight updates
- Learning rate decay
- Checkpoint saving/loading

### 3. Visual Feedback
The Ebiten-based visualization shows:
- Current pendulum state
- Network predictions
- Real-time performance metrics

## Success Criteria
1. **Short-term**: Pendulum stays upright for >5 seconds
2. **Mid-term**: Recovers from small perturbations
3. **Long-term**: Maintains stability indefinitely
