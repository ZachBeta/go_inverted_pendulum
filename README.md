# Go Inverted Pendulum Reinforcement Learning Framework

A Go-based framework implementing reinforcement learning concepts with a focus on performance and maintainability, specifically designed for the inverted pendulum control problem.

## Overview
This project implements reinforcement learning principles in Go, focusing on:
- State management and transitions
- Action space definition and execution
- Reward system implementation
- Environment simulation

## Quick Start
```bash
# Run the window demo
go run cmd/window/main.go
